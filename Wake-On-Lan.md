# Wake On Lan Plugin
--------------------------------------------

[Wake-on-LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN) (WOL) is an Ethernet computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or awakened by a network message. This plugin allows you to send a "magic packet" to a certain mac address in the local network.

> **Note**: The WOL service has to be enabled on the host computer.
