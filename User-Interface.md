# User Interfaces

Since you are such a smarty pants and has installed guhIO, you are now in the lucky position to choose from various user interfaces. Each of the UI's has it's own advantages.

First, the web interface - control your smart home on your desktop over the browser. It is the most convinient way to do the initial setup of guhIO. 

To use a smartphone app is the comfortable way for the everyday use. On the dashboard you have the devices you use the most at a glance. Perfect for remote controling your connected gadgets - remote control outside of your wifi network is currently not working, but will be able soon.

For development and debugging is the Command Line Interface the best choice. Right out of your Terminal you have the tool to call every function of guhIO. To sniff all the data of guhIO is also possible, like reading the log files.

# Web Interface

guhIO has a built in web server. Take the browser that you prefer and type in the adress of your device guhIO is running on.

If you don't know how to access the web server, take a look at the [getting started wiki](https://github.com/guh/guh/wiki/Getting-started#access-the-web-interface)

The web interface is in an early development stage, in a couple of weeks it will look more fancy, just look out for updates.
