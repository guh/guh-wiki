# WeMo Plugin
--------------------------------------------

This plugin allows to find and controll devices from WeMo, the [Belkin home automation system](http://www.belkin.com/de/PRODUKTE/home-automation/c/wemo-home-automation/).

Currently only the WeMo Switch is supported.

> **Note**: The devices can only be discovered if they are already in the local network. In order to configure the WeMo devices please use the original software.
