# Using the *guh-cli*
--------------------------------------------

The *guh-cli* (command line interface) is an admin tool written in python to communicate with the [*guh*](https://github.com/guh/guh) JSON-RPC API and test functionality of *guh*.

## Installation 
--------------------------------------------

First make sure you have installed *python 2.7*. You can find the installation instruction on the [official python homepage](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).

Now you can clone the [guh-cli repository](https://github.com/guh/guh-cli) from github:

    $ git clone https://github.com/guh/guh-cli.git
    $ cd guh-cli/    

## Usage 
--------------------------------------------
   
In order to start guh-cli you need to know on which host *guh* is currently running. If guh is running on `localhost`, you can start the application as follows:

    $ python2 guh-cli.py

If *guh* is running on a certain host, (i.e. `192.168.1.13`), you can pass the IP as a parameter:

    $ python2 guh-cli.py 192.168.1.13
    
Once *guh-cli* has established the connection, you will see the main menu. In the main menu you can either use the arrow keys to navigate or the item number of the menu list.
