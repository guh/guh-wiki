# Getting started with *nymead*
--------------------------------------------
Once you have installed *nymea* successfully you can start the *nymead* daemon. There are two possibility's to start nymead:

* starting nymea as daemon (service)
* starting nymea as application (terminal application) and see all debug outputs.

In order to get help you can type in the terminal `nymead -h`:

    $ nymead -h
    Usage: nymead [options]

                                                will be bound to the session bus
                                                instead of the system bus.
      -d, --debug-category <[No]DebugCategory>  ...


Also a manual page is available:

    $ man nymead

By default, `nymead` will start as a daemon. If you want to start nymead as an application, you can pass the parameter `-n` and it will start in the foreground. 

If you want to see a special debug category, you can pass that category to the parameter. You can find all available categories in the help message (`nymead -h`):

> **Example:** start nymead in the foreground and enable the `JsonRpc` and `Hardware` and disable the `DeviceManager` debug messages:

    $ nymead -n -d JsonRpc -d Hardware -d NoDeviceManager

## Systemd service

The `nymead` package provides also systemd service, which allows you to start, stop, restart and get the status the *nymea*-daemon.

Start the service:

    $ sudo systemctl start nymead

Stop the service:

    $ sudo systemctl stop nymead

Restart the service:

    $ sudo systemctl restart nymead

Get the status of the service:

    $ sudo systemctl status nymead

### Autostart nymead
If you want to auto start nymead on boot, you can enable the service by calling following command:

    $ sudo systemctl enable nymead
    
    Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nymead.service to /etc/systemd/system/nymead.service.

### Disable autostart nymead
If you want to disable auto starting nymead on boot, you can call following command:

    $ sudo systemctl disable nymead
    
    Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nymead.service.

### Follow debug output

If you have nymead running in the background (as daemon and started with systemd) you can see the live debug out by monitoring the log file. You can do that with following command:

    $ journalctl -f -u nymead
