### nymea:app platform support

nymea:app is written in Qt and supports all platforms supported by Qt natively (better performance than WebApps, more fluid UX).

*   Easy setup (no port forwarding in firewall required)
    *   No DynDNS or VPM server needed
    *   End-to-end encryption
*   Push-notifications
    *   Available on Android and iOS

### IoT device services

* Integrated webserver
    * Servers nymea-internal services (e.g. debug interface, see below)
    * Can host one or more 3rd Party websites (e.g. vendor related web services, user defined websites)
* Integrated MQTT Broker (WIP)
    * Can act as a MQTT server/broker
    * Can join other MQTT broker networks as a client

    * ZeroConf supported
    * UPnP supported

        
### Box network connectivity

* Ethernet
    * Autoconfiguring via DHCP
* WiFi Setup
    * Integration of BerryLan for end-user friendly WiFi configuration over Bluetooth

        
### Connection interfaces

*  API available on interfaces
    * Plain TCP/JSONRPC
    * WebSockets/JSONRPC
* Encryption
    * Plaintext connection supported
    * SSL: Every channel supports encryption and host verification using SSL
* Authentication modes
    * No authentication: nymea can be configured to be openly available in the local network
    * User/Password: Username and password authentication can be enabled
    * PushButton: For better user experience clients can authenticate via PushButton (Hardware support required)
* Remote connection
    * nymea:core accessible from anywhere with end-user friendly setup powered by nymea:cloud.
    * No Port forwarding setup in firewall required.

### Supported device categories

* extended support for known device classes
    * access control (fingerprint readers, keycards etc)
    * awnings, blinds, shutters
    * battery powered devices (support for battery alert states)
    * buttons/switches
    * lights (simple, dimmable, color)
    * smart meters
    * doors, gates (garage gates etc)
    * sensors (humidity, temperature, moisutre, pressure, light, ...)
    * media (controlling media devices)
    * alerts/notifications (send alerts e.g. low battery, intruder detection)
    * weather services
    * operating system (allows nymea controlling the system it runs on e.g. trigger updates)
* any other device/service can be integrated with flexible and generic states/events/actions

### Rules

* Rules can be defined to add smart behavior to devices/services
    * Rules are triggered by state changes and events
        * By a single device/service (e.g. sensor X reports value Y)
        * By a category (e.g. Any of my devices runs out of battery)
    * Rules evaluate further state in the system
    * Rules change device states or trigger actions on devices
        * On a singleor multiple selected device/service (e.g. turn on light 1 and light 3)
        * On a category of devices/services (e.g. close all gates)

### Tags 

* Tags can be added to all things and rules 
    * Group devices by rooms, buildings etc...
    * Tag devices/services as favorites

### Debugging/troubleshooting:

* An optional Debug webinterface for easy troubleshooting, debugging and filing support requests
    * Allows to get all information, configuration and logs of the system
* GNU Debugger "gdb" package provided
* Configurable debug output with command line options

### Developer support

* SDK
    * Qt SDK (Qt * QtCreator)
    * Infinite amount of mature and professional developer tools around C/C**
    * nymea QtCreator Wizard integration for easy plugin development
* Fully documented
    * [https://doc.nymea.io](https://doc.nymea.io)
    * [https://wiki.nymea.io](https://wiki.nymea.io)
    * [https://forum.nymea.io](https://forum.nymea.io)
* Supported hardware layers
    * Hardware/Protocol abstraction layers for easy plugin development available
        * Bluetooth
        * NFC
        * coap
        * 443 Mhz radio
        * WiFi/Ethernet/Internet connected devices/services (e.g. HTTP REST APIs usable with minimal code effort)
        * ZigBee (WIP)
        * MQTT (WIP)
    * Any other transport protocols can be used hand-crafted in a plugin
    * All libraries available in Linux available to use

## Rule Engine

* Event based Actions - Example: on sunrise open the blinds
* Actions triggered on State changes - If the doorlock state has changed send a notification and add the status to the text body
* Action triggered by a certain state value - If state door locked changed to closed activate the alarm  
* Exit actions - after an action was triggerd by a certain state value another action may be defined when the condition isn't met anymore.
* Time triggered Actions - Every Tuesday and Thursday turn on the hot tub heating at 4p.m and turn it off at 8 p.m
* Device type based actions - On button pressed turn all lights off
* Value takeover - If message received send a push-notification with the content in the text body.
* Example Nuimo turning knob turning status linked to the hue brightness
* Various combination - Combine time frames with state values and events to trigger multiple actions.
* Rule Active/Inactive - For example a irrigation rule doesn't have to be deleted rather set inactive when not needed
* Scenes - Create a scene by making a rule executable so it can be triggered by a client

## Log Database

Every state, action and event is logged wihtin a database that is setup automatically with the nymea isntallation.

* State initialization - on restart of nymea the states can be configured to load the latest state before shutdown
* Database exchangeable - mySQL ....
* Filter for device types
* Filter for a certain amount of entries
* Filter for entries in a given timeframe
* Filter for a dedicated device

## Plug-Ins

Check the nymea-plugins repository for the latest plug-in list.

Though every plug-in have the same structure the main usage for plug-ins can be categorised as following:

* Simulation Plug-Ins - simulation of common device categories, used for tests or getting used to nymea
* Commander Plug-Ins - low level plug-in for example to receive or send TCP packages
* Device Plug-Ins - Add devices to nymea like Philips Hue
* Service Plug-Ins - integrate online services, like Netatmo or OpenWeather Map
