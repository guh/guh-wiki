# Welcome to *nymea wiki*
*nymea* is an advanced open IoT platform written in Qt.

The main purpose of nymea is to provide a collection of tools, libraries and services to build IoT devices. Nymea can be used to solve specific small problems for IoT based use cases as well as building a fully featured automation platform.

## Example usages of nymea are:
* [Raspberry Pi headless WiFi setup](http://berrylan.org)
* [Smart garage gates](https://smartwithmaveo.com)
* [Smart hot tubs](https://www.hackster.io/124582/open-source-hot-tub-controller-e0a1f3)
* MQTT broker
* [Smart home setups](https://www.hackster.io/michael_zanetti/open-source-smart-home-with-touchscreen-control-panel-55e613)
* Standalone/offline if this than that setups
* and many more

# nymea structure

nymea consists of three parts: nymea:core, nymea:ux and nymea:cloud.

## nymea:core

nymea:core is the core piece of the platform. It refers to the services and libraries used to build the edge device. It may run on a low end IoT device, on a Raspberry Pi, on a Linux PC (or VM) or even in a cloud server instance.

A typical smart home setup for instance would run a nymea:core on a Raspberry Pi in a home network and talk to IoT devices in the home via WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee etc.

A smart hot tub for instance would run nymea:core in a embedded device in the Hot Tub (e.g. a Beaglebone Black, or a Raspberry Pi) and control the hot tup through GPIOs.

A self-hosted if this than that instance may run nymea:core on a AWS server instance and connect to various other web services.

## nymea:ux

nymea:ux refers to the user facing frontend of a nymea system. This can be a client app running on a phone, a frontend app running on the IoT edge device too (in case it has a display) or a command line interface. Please refer to the [Clients](https://nymea.io/en/wiki/nymea/master/clients) page for available frontends.

## nymea:cloud

nymea:cloud is optional and extends nymea with cloud centric features such as delivering push notifications to client devices or enabling remote connections from nymea:ux to nymea:core in an easy to setup and secure manner.

The project is initiated by guh GmbH, the company behind [nymea.io](https://nymea.io). The purpose of it is to deliver full-stack IoT services and the nymea framework plays a key role into that.
