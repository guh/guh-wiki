# Configuration
--------------------------------------------

## Settings
--------------------------------------------

The location of the personal settings like configured devices, rules and plugins depends on the user who starts nymead.

**User** - If you start nymead as user, the settings can be found in the home directory of the corresponding user:

        ~/.config/nymea/*

**root** -  If you start nymead as root or the system starts it with the init script, the personal settings will be stored in:

        /etc/nymea/*


#### Reset configuration

**user** - If you start nymead as user, you will have to delete following files:

        $ rm -v ~/.config/nymea/*

**root** -  If you start nymead as root or the system starts it with the init script, you will have to delete following files:

        $ sudo rm -v /etc/nymea/*

> **Note:** you need to restart nymead to clean up also the runtime configurations after deleting the configuration files.

#### Logging Database

The logging database is a sqlite3 database and contains every log event of the nymead server.

**user** - If you start nymead as user, the logging database will be stored in:

        ~/.config/nymea/nymead.sqlite

**root** -  If you start nymead as root or the system starts it with the init script, the logging database will be stored in:

        /var/log/nymead.sqlite

To reset the database, just delete the file and restart nymead.
