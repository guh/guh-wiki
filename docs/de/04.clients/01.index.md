# Clients
--------------------------------------------

Once you have successfully installed nymea, we offer two different ways to interface with it. One is a fully featured app for Windows / MacOS / Android & iOS that is built using Qt. The other way is using the built in cli which is written in python.


* [nymea:app](/en/wiki/nymea/master/clients/nymea-app): The Qt client application.
* [nymea-cli](/en/wiki/nymea/master/clients/nymea-cli): The nymea command line interface written in python.
