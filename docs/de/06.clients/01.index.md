# Clients
--------------------------------------------

If you have successfully installed nymea, you are now in the lucky position to choose between different client applications. Each of the clients has it's own purpose.

* [nymea-cli](/en/wiki/nymea/master/clients/nymea-cli): The nymea command line interface written in python.
* [nymea:app](https://github.com/guh/nymea-app): The Qt client application.
