# Time Plugin
--------------------------------------------

The time plugin allows you create rules based on the time, day, month, year, weekday or on weekend. For the setup you need to specify the continent, afterwards you can select your city/timezone. The language of the "month name" and "weekday name" depends on your locale settings. To have the correct time you need [ntp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol).
